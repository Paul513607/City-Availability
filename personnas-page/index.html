				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p><strong>"A persona is a user archetype you can use to help guide decisions about product features, navigation, interactions, and even visual design." (Kim Goodwin, Cooper.com)</strong></p>
				<p>
                    Maria Popescu is a high school professor who enjoys shopping in her free time. She has been diagnosed with visual impairment that makes it difficult for her to navigate public spaces and read small print. Maria is an avid user of technology and relies heavily on her smartphone to stay organized and connected with her colleagues, friends, and family.
                    In her work life, Maria is a dedicated professor who is passionate about helping her students learn and succeed. 
                    In her social life, Maria values spending time with her family and friends. She enjoys trying out new restaurants and cafes and meeting with friends.
                    When it comes to shopping, Maria is always on the lookout for good deals and high-quality products. However, her visual impairment can make it challenging for her to compare prices, read labels, and locate items in crowded stores. She also finds it frustrating when stores don't offer clear and concise product information on their websites or in their physical locations.

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>
                Scenario 1:
                Maria goes to the mall on a busy Saturday afternoon. She enters the mall, but soon realizes that navigating through the crowd and finding the stores she needs is challenging due to her visual impairment. She feels anxious and frustrated as she tries to follow the signs and find the stores she needs. <br>
                End point: Maria feels discouraged and frustrated due to her inability to navigate the mall.          
            </p>
            <p>
                Maria plans to meet her friend for lunch at a restaurant in the mall. She has trouble finding the restaurant due to her visual impairment and the lack of clear signage. She asks for help from a mall employee and finally locates the restaurant.  <br>
                End point: Maria is relieved to find the restaurant, but the fact that she had to ask for help makes her feel embarrassed.
