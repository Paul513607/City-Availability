      <h2>Context of use</h2>
      <div class="inner-container">
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <div class="inner-container">
          <p>
            We chose Palas Mall for our project due to its central location in Iasi and its
            popularity among diverse visitors. As the largest mall in the city, it offers us
            valuable insights into real-world usability challenges. By addressing these issues, we
            can make a meaningful impact on the local community, creating a more inclusive and
            enjoyable environment for all visitors.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <div class="inner-container">
          <p>
            The layout of the shopping mall consists of multiple floors connected by escalators,
            elevators, or stairs. Stores are typically arranged in clusters, with anchor stores
            located at opposite ends of the mall. There are also common areas for dining,
            entertainment, and relaxation, such as food courts, cinema, and seating areas.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <div class="inner-container">
          <p>
            Palas Mall is usually a busy and vibrant environment, with a lot of visual and auditory
            stimuli. It can be noisy and crowded, especially during peak hours or holidays. Lighting
            and temperature are carefully controlled to create a comfortable and inviting
            atmosphere. There are also various amenities such as restrooms, ATMs, and information
            desks to assist visitors.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Users</h3>
        <div class="inner-container">
          <p>
            The users of the shopping mall are diverse and can include people of all ages, genders,
            and cultural backgrounds. They visit the mall for different reasons, such as shopping,
            dining, entertainment, or socializing. Some visitors are frequent shoppers who know
            their way around, while others may be first-time visitors who are unfamiliar with the
            layout and amenities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Goals and Tasks</h3>
        <div class="inner-container">
          <p>
            The goals and tasks of mall visitors can vary widely depending on their reasons for
            visiting. Shoppers may be looking for specific items or simply browsing for inspiration.
            Diners may be looking for a quick bite or a leisurely meal. Entertainment seekers may be
            looking for a specific movie or game, or just something fun to do. Visitors may also
            have different needs and preferences, such as accessibility requirements, language
            barriers, or cultural sensitivities.

      <h2>Metaphors/idioms, affordances and visual variables</h2>
      <p>
        Metaphors/idioms, affordances, and visual variables are all important design elements that
        can greatly enhance the usability and user experience of a shopping mall. Here are some
        examples of how these design elements could be used:
      </p>
      <h3>Metaphors/Idioms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A shopping cart metaphor could be used in the mall's website to make it easier for users
          to add items to their cart and checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
          The idiom "swipe left" could be used to communicate to users that they can swipe left to
          see more product details.
        </li>
        <li>
          The idiom "tap to select" could be used to communicate to users that they can tap on a
          product to select it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Affordances</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The affordance of a push/pull handle could be used on doors to communicate how to open
          them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The affordance of a tactile surface on a door handle could communicate to users that they
          should pull the door to open it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The affordance of a button on an elevator could be used to communicate how to call the
          elevator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Visual variables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A specific color scheme or logo could be used to distinguish between different types of
          stores or departments in a mall map.
        </li>
        <li>
          The size and placement of store signs could be used to communicate their relative
          importance and location within the mall.
        </li>
        <li>
          The use of icons and symbols could be used to create a visual association between a store
          and its products or services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="delimiter"></div>

      <h2>Usability problems observed and potential improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Inadequate signage for restrooms, exits, and stores:</strong><br />Improvement:
          Install larger signs with high-contrast colors, braille, and universally recognized
          symbols to help all visitors navigate more easily.
        </li>
        <img src="./resources/signage.jpg" alt="Signage Example" width="500" height="500" />
        <li>
          <strong>Limited seating areas, especially near high-traffic locations:</strong
          ><br />Improvement: Add comfortable seating areas throughout the mall, with a focus on
          high-traffic locations and rest areas. Ensure these seating spaces have wheelchair
          accessible seating as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Touchscreen directory maps with small fonts and poor contrast:</strong
          ><br />Improvement: Redesign the touchscreen directories to include larger fonts,
          high-contrast colors, and simplified graphics. Add auditory feedback to make the interface
          more accessible for visually impaired users.
        </li>
        <img
          src="./resources/touch-screen-directory.jpg"
          alt="Touchscreen Directory Example"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        />
        <li>
          <strong>Narrow aisles and inaccessible store entrances for wheelchair users:</strong
          ><br />Improvement: Work with store owners to widen aisles and modify store entrances to
          accommodate wheelchair users. Implement accessible ramps and automatic doors where
          necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No audible guidance for visually impaired visitors:</strong><br />Improvement:
          Introduce an audio-guidance system using strategically placed speakers, Bluetooth beacons,
          or a dedicated mobile app to provide directions and information for visually impaired
          visitors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="delimiter"></div>
      <h2>Additional software improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mobile app for personalized mall navigation:</strong><br />Develop a mobile app
          that offers personalized navigation, including accessible routes and turn-by-turn
          directions for all visitors, including those with special needs. The app can also provide
          real-time information on store promotions and events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Indoor positioning system (IPS):</strong><br />Implement an indoor positioning
          system using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other technologies to help users locate themselves
          within the mall, enhancing their navigation experience.
        </li>
        <img
          src="./resources/indoor-positioning-system.jpg"
          alt="Indoor Positioning System Example"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        />
        <li>
          <strong>Augmented reality (AR) support:</strong><br />Integrate augmented reality features
          into the mobile app to provide users with visual overlays that highlight important
          information, such as store names, accessible entrances, and other points of interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conversational UI agent:</strong><br />Incorporate a conversational UI agent, such
          as a chatbot, into the mobile app to provide users with an alternative way to access
          information and ask questions, enhancing the overall user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="delimiter"></div>

      <h2>Empirical laws, affordances, and flow in the context of the improved solutions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fitts' Law</strong>
          <div class="inner-container">
            <strong>Definition:</strong> States that the time it takes to move to a target area is a
            function of the distance to the target and the size of the target.
            <br />
            <strong>Usage:</strong> By making interactive elements, such as touchscreen directories
            and mobile app interfaces, more accessible and easier to use, visitors can interact with
            them more efficiently.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hick' Law</strong>
          <div class="inner-container">
            <strong>Definition:</strong> States that the time it takes to make a decision is a
            function of the number of options available.
            <br />
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Simplified navigation and reduced choices on the touchscreen
            directory and mobile app help users make decisions faster, resulting in a more
            streamlined experience.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Steering' Law</strong>
          <div class="inner-container">
            <strong>Definition:</strong> States that the time it takes to move a cursor to a target
            is a function of the angle between the starting position and the target, as well as the
            distance to the target.
            <br />
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Wider aisles, accessible store entrances, and improved
            navigation minimize the need for complex, precision-based movements, enabling users to
            move more easily through the mall.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Affordances</strong>
          <div class="inner-container">
            Clear visual cues, such as high-contrast signage and accessible route indicators, help
            users better understand the environment and navigate more effectively.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flow</strong>
          <div class="inner-container">
            The combination of improved navigation, better accessibility, and enhanced usability
            create a more enjoyable and efficient experience for all users, including those with
            special needs. As a result, visitors will be more likely to have a positive experience
            and return to the shopping mall in the future.
