    <h1>Palas Mall Accessibility Improvements</h1>
    <h2>Location: Palas Mall</h2>

    <h2>Main Personnas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maria Popescu, high-school teacher</li>
      <li>Alexandru Antal, store owner</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="personnas-page/index.html">Here is a more detailed overview of chosen personnas</a>

    <h2>Usability problems observed and potential improvements:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Inadequate signage for restrooms, exits, and stores:</strong><br />Improvement:
        Install larger signs with high-contrast colors, braille, and universally recognized symbols
        to help all visitors navigate more easily.
      </li>
      <img src="https://example.com/signage.jpg" alt="Signage Example" />
      <li>
        <strong>Limited seating areas, especially near high-traffic locations:</strong
        ><br />Improvement: Add comfortable seating areas throughout the mall, with a focus on
        high-traffic locations and rest areas. Ensure these seating spaces have wheelchair
        accessible seating as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Touchscreen directory maps with small fonts and poor contrast:</strong
        ><br />Improvement: Redesign the touchscreen directories to include larger fonts,
        high-contrast colors, and simplified graphics. Add auditory feedback to make the interface
        more accessible for visually impaired users.
      </li>
      <img src="https://example.com/touchscreen.jpg" alt="Touchscreen Directory Example" />
      <li>
        <strong>Narrow aisles and inaccessible store entrances for wheelchair users:</strong
        ><br />Improvement: Work with store owners to widen aisles and modify store entrances to
        accommodate wheelchair users. Implement accessible ramps and automatic doors where
        necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No audible guidance for visually impaired visitors:</strong><br />Improvement:
        Introduce an audio-guidance system using strategically placed speakers, Bluetooth beacons,
        or a dedicated mobile app to provide directions and information for visually impaired
        visitors.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional software improvements:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Mobile app for personalized mall navigation:</strong><br />Develop a mobile app that
        offers personalized navigation, including accessible routes and turn-by-turn directions for
        all visitors, including those with special needs. The app can also provide real-time
        information on store promotions and events.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Indoor positioning system (IPS):</strong><br />Implement an indoor positioning
        system using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other technologies to help users locate themselves within
        the mall, enhancing their navigation experience.
      </li>
      <img
        src="https://example.com/indoor_positioning.jpg"
        alt="Indoor Positioning System Example"
      />
      <li>
        <strong>Augmented reality (AR) support:</strong><br />Integrate augmented reality features
        into the mobile app to provide users with visual overlays that highlight important
        information, such as store names, accessible entrances, and other points of interest.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Conversational UI agent:</strong><br />Incorporate a conversational UI agent, such
        as a chatbot, into the mobile app to provide users with an alternative way to access
        information and ask questions, enhancing the overall user experience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Empirical laws, affordances, and flow in the context of the improved solutions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Fitts' Law:</strong> By making interactive elements, such as touchscreen directories
        and mobile app interfaces, more accessible and easier to use, visitors can interact with
        them more efficiently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hick's Law:</strong> Simplified navigation and reduced choices on the touchscreen
        directory and mobile app help users make decisions faster, resulting in a more streamlined
        experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steering Law:</strong> Wider aisles, accessible store entrances, and improved
        navigation minimize the need for complex, precision-based movements, enabling users to move
        more easily through the mall.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Affordances:</strong> Clear visual cues, such as high-contrast signage and
        accessible route indicators, help users better understand the environment and navigate more
        effectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flow:</strong> The combination of improved navigation, better accessibility, and
        enhanced usability create a more enjoyable and efficient experience for all users, including
        those with special needs. As a result, visitors will be more likely to have a positive
        experience and return to the shopping mall in the future.
      </li>
